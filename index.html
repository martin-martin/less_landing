				"As a self-taught software developer, I've wanted to experience the reality of Silicon Valley for a long time. But the cost of living in the Bay Area is simply too high for me to rent a place ­ and hotel rooms are absurdly unaffordable. With LESS I was able to easily sift my way through affordable options ­ many of them even free! Those 1.99$ saved me hundreds of Dollars and allowed me to easily spend 2 months on the West Coast without busting my budget."
